Process: An instance of a program (e.g a python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared bewtween processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable / killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoiids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
